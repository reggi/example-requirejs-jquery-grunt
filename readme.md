# RequireJS + jQuery + Grunt

## Install Dependancies

```
bower install && npm install
```

This will install the following:

* [jquery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
* [grunt-contrib-requirejs](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-requirejs)
* [grunt-contrib-watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch)

## Watch script

```
grunt watch
```

If you run watch it will keep tabs on anything that happens within `/assets_src/javascript/`, and on a change it will compile out one file.
